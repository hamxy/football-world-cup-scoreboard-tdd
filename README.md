# 🏆 Football World Cup ScoreBoard (TDD)

## 📌 Objective

Design and implement a simple in-memory ScoreBoard system for tracking football matches, using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and following **SOLID** and **Clean Code** principles.

---

## ✅ Functional Requirements

1. **Start a game** – initialize a match with home and away teams, starting at 0–0.
2. **Update score** – update the score for a specific game.
3. **Finish a game** – remove a match from the scoreboard.
4. **Get summary** – return a list of matches ordered by:
    - total score (home + away), descending
    - for ties: by most recently added match first

## 🧪 Development Approach – TDD

This project was implemented fully using **TDD**, following the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

1. **Red** – write a failing test
2. **Green** – implement just enough to make the test pass
3. **Refactor** – clean up the code without breaking functionality

Also, I was trying to commit after completing each step of Red-Green-Refactor cycle to show my approach and progress. I believe this would be too often, and in real-world scenario I would probably commit after the whole cycle, not after each step.

## 📚 Learning Note

Although I studied the concept of **TDD** during my studies, this is my **first project** built entirely using the TDD approach. Before starting the implementation, I spent a few days to strengthen my understanding by reading a book about TDD in Java and completing exercises from the book.
